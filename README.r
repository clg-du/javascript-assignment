#+ echo = FALSE
#'
#' ## Overview
#'
#' In this assignment, you will be working with three different JavaScript
#' projects. Each project has a different focus and set of requirements. You
#' will be required to complete each project and submit the code for evaluation.
#'
#' Your task is to complete the projects by following the instructions provided
#' by the comments in the JavaScript files. You will be required to write code
#' to implement the functionality described in the comments.
#'
#' You will submit the completed JavaScript files for each project (each folder)
#' in a .zip file. The .zip file should contain the three JavaScript files, one
#' for each project.
#'
#' Assignment details and minimum requirements to pass are outlined below. You
#' may use this project style or syntax as inspiration for your own projects.
#'
#' ## Assignment Details
#'
#' - **Title:** JavaScript implementations
#'
#' - **Objective:** To implement JavaScript functionality in three different
#' projects
#'
#' - **Requirements:** You will need to achieve the base functionality for each
#' project as outlined in the comments in the JavaScript files. Styling is
#' optional, but you are encouraged to style the projects to make them visually
#' appealing using your knowledge of HTML and CSS.
#'
#' - **Submission:** You will submit a .zip file containing the modified
#' JavaScript files for each project (each folder). The .zip file should contain
#' three JavaScript files, one for each project.
#'
#' ## Getting started
#'
#' 1. Clone the repository containing the JavaScript projects to your local
#' machine using Git or download the .zip file.
#'
#' 2. Extract the contents of the .zip file to a local directory on your
#' computer or make a local copy of the repository using Git.
#'
#' 3. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor or code editor of your choice.
#'
#' - **Important note**: You will exclusively work with the JavaScript files
#' provided in the repository. You will not need to modify the HTML file, but
#' may add CSS to style the projects. If you choose to add CSS, you can add it
#' to an external CSS file and include in your submission (each folder).
#'
#' 4. Write your JavaScript code in the provided JavaScript files to implement
#' the functionality described in the comments.
#'
#' - **Important note**: Add comments, e.g., `//`, to document your code and
#' explain the purpose of each function or block of code (briefly)
#'
#' 5. Once you have completed the projects, ensure that the JavaScript files are
#' saved with your changes. You can test the functionality of the projects by
#' opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. CSS functionality need to be
#' tested by adding the CSS file to the HTML file.
#'
#' 6. Create a ZIP file containing the projects (all three) with the modified
#' JavaScript files. The ZIP file should contain three folders, each
#' corresponding to a project, with the modified JavaScript file for that
#' project as well as index.html file and CSS file (if you have added CSS).
#'
#' 7. Submit the ZIP file to the assignment platform for evaluation.
#'
#' ## Minimum Requirements to pass assignment
#'
#' - **Base functionality**: Implement the base functionality for each project
#' as outlined in the comments in the JavaScript files. The base functionality
#' should be implemented in the JavaScript files provided. You may add CSS to
#' style the projects, but it is **optional**.
#'
#' - **Comments**: Add comments to document your code and explain the purpose of
#' each function or block of code (briefly). Comments should be added to the
#' JavaScript files, and badly documented code will be penalized.
#'
#' ## Grading Criteria
#'
#' - All three projects must be completed and submitted in a .zip file.
#'
#' - The assignment will be graded based on the completion of the base
#' functionality for each project as outlined in the comments in the JavaScript
#' files.
#'
#' - The tasks can be solved in a variety of ways, and you are encouraged to
#' explore different approaches to solving the problems and no single solution
#' will be considered correct as long as the base functionality is implemented.
#' However, comments will be given to explain how the code could be improved.
#'
#' - Styling is optional, but you are encouraged to style the projects to make
#' them visually appealing using your knowledge of HTML and CSS.
#'
#' - The code should be well-documented with comments to explain the purpose of
#' each function or block of code.
#'
#' - Comments will be provided upon completion of the assignment, detailing
#' which requirements were met and which were not.
